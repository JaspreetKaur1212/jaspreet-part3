                                <p>The LARQ bottle uses state-of-the-art UV-C light technology to sterilize both the bottle and the water inside. UV-C light has been proven to kill 99.99% of harmful bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. With just a press of a button, the LARQ bottle activates a 60-second cycle of UV-C light that purifies your water, ensuring it is safe to drink. The bottle's self-cleaning feature runs every two hours, keeping the bottle itself free from harmful germs, ensuring your water stays fresh, and you stay hydrated on the go.</p>

                                <p>Yes! The LARQ bottle is equipped with a built-in rechargeable lithium-polymer battery. A single charge lasts up to a month, depending on usage. You can recharge the bottle using the provided USB-C cable. The battery is designed to be long-lasting, ensuring that you don't have to charge it often, making it a perfect companion for travel, daily commutes, or outdoor adventures.</p>

                                <p>The LARQ bottle itself is not dishwasher safe, as the UV-C light cap contains delicate electronics. To ensure longevity, we recommend hand-washing the bottle with mild soap and warm water. However, the bottle's design is simple and easy to clean, and the bottle's self-cleaning feature ensures that it stays free from bacteria and odors. Just activate the self-cleaning feature regularly, and the bottle remains hygienic without requiring deep cleaning.</p>

The light cycle is fast and efficient, meaning you can drink purified water almost immediately. Once the self-cleaning cycle is completed, the bottle automatically powers off. This means you don't have to worry about keeping track of the timer.</p>

First, regularly activate the self-cleaning cycle to eliminate bacteria and odor. Second, wash the cap and bottle by hand with warm water and a mild soap solution. Do not submerge the cap in water. Finally, ensure the bottle is dried thoroughly after washing to avoid any build-up of moisture.</p>

                                <p>UV-C light is a powerful ultraviolet radiation that kills bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms by disrupting their DNA. LARQ uses a specific wavelength of UV-C light (around 260 to 280 nanometers) that is particularly effective in sterilizing water. The self-cleaning mechanism in the LARQ bottle utilizes this UV-C light to purify the water inside, ensuring that it is free from contaminants that may cause illness or unpleasant odors.</p>

While you can technically fill it with other liquids, we recommend sticking to water or tea to maintain optimal performance and prevent any unwanted odors or residues from building up. Additionally, liquids like smoothies or juices may cause clogging or staining due to their consistency. Stick to water for the best results!</p>
